<h3>REVIEW</h3>
<h4>A Musical Feast</h4>
<h4>by LGM</h4>

<p>A musical feast was somewhat of a fabulous dinner dance with four lively dances of the Slavonic and Hungarian kind included.</p>

<p>The opening Slavonic Dances Numbers 1 and 8 by Anton Dvorak were an indication of the feast to follow. The rhythm and exuberance was conveyed so well we didn’t need to actually see the dancers performing those tricky steps. Brahms Hungarian dances which lead the second part of the program were similarly very lively and invigorating; Brahms used folk songs extensively in these pieces and while being no expert I felt quite a bit of gypsy music infiltrated them.</p>

<p>N.S.W Soprano, Julie O’Connor sang four of the most beautiful songs in the repertoire. Her voice was pure and very versatile in the range of notes required. She also had the best facial and hand gestures I have seen which really enhances the enjoyment of the music. Many singers, whilst having a great voice, tend to be wooden in gesture and stance. The Orchestra was very much part of the song, never intruding but always asserting its contribution to the overall beauty of the music.</p>

<p>In this 150 anniversary year of Sibelius Finlandia was a joy to hear again. This became Finland’s unofficial anthem during the independence war against Russia (played under a variety of names so as to not to antagonise the aggressors) in the 1890’s and is very stirring</p>

<p>My friend commented that “The BRO’s interpretation under Mark Shiell's baton was crisp, and the move from the dark, atmospheric mood to the lighter song or hymn seemed startling, this was done so beautifully and effortlessly. As a non musician, I loved it.”</p>

<p>A musical feast without Beethoven and Bach would be like food without salt. We were privileged to hear Bach’s Double Violin Concerto’s 1st movement with two of the many talented young players from the orchestra, Julia Ramsbotham and Florence Cappler-Shillington, masterfully playing the double solo and the orchestra’s string section ably accompanying them. Beethoven’s 5th Symphony’s first movement was slightly different as Conductor Mark Shiell’s research showed that Ludwig Van originally meant it to be at a different tempo to what we are now accustomed to hear. The Orchestra certainly showed how right he was, every note could be heard and every note added up to a most beautiful piece of music which was over too soon.</p>

<p>For me the piece de resistance of the concert was Rossini’s William Tell Overture, the first part with the cellos and double basses was sublime then I found I just didn’t want the storm to finish but when the Trumpets heralded the more familiar part I was carried along with the galloping music – it was great music played very well.</p>

<p>For that little bit of extra chocolate we were treated to a repeat of the Hungarian Dance No 5.</p>

<p>So Bravo Mark, Bravo Musicians, Bravo everyone who contributed - as I say after almost every concert – This has been the best concert yet. </p>

<h3>REVIEW</h3>
<h4>World Music Concert</h4>
<h4>by Helen Land</h4>

<p>The World Music Concert was a breath of fresh air to Townsville music lovers who had just about reached classical music saturation following AFCM.</p>

<p>Andrew Ryder poured his expertise and enthusiasm into this opportunity provided through Townsville City Council sponsorship. Andrew developed the concept for the concert; sourced the music which involved him personally arranging some of the music; liaising with the professional performers; and rehearsing and conducting the Barrier Reef Orchestra.</p>

<p>The performance delighted more than one sense through the visual backdrop showing scenery pertinent to the music and the amazing musical sound evoking toe tapping, clapping, singing and sheer enjoyment.</p>

<p>The world tour began with David Hudson on didgeridoo, guitar and vocals synchronizing with the visual backdrop to grab the audiences’ attention, performing the popular John Williamson ballad Raining on the Rock. The tour continued through Korea and Cuba courtesy of a quality Barrier Reef Orchestral performance. Next, virtuosic Domenico Taraborrelli on piano accordion and vocalist Adam Lopez, supported by the Orchestra, engaged the audience with Latin American pieces. Unfortunately the balance was a little off, with the soloists being much louder.</p>

<p>The second half began with the Barrier Reef Orchestra creating an American theme through Aaron Copland before heading off to Europe with the Orchestra supporting Domenico once again in Italy, John Ferguson on bagpipes with vocalist Cynthia Clark in Scotland and Adam Lopez in Spain.</p>

<p>The tour aptly returned to Australia with all the soloists returning to the stage to present a rousing and emotive performance of I am Australian.</p>

<p>This very enjoyable performance once again demonstrated the talented people choosing to live in Townsville and able to produce such a high class production, equal to anywhere. This was reinforced by the willingness of quality professional musicians to come to Townsville and perform with the Barrier Reef Orchestra. I feel certain if more was known about the concert the Civic Theatre would easily have been at capacity. </p>

<h3>REVIEW</h3>
<p>AFCM 25th Anniversary Celebration Concert</p>
<p>by Helen Land</p>
<img src="img/AFCM01.jpg" alt="" style="padding-left: 10px">
<p>A very pleasant Sunday afternoon in Queens Gardens was attended by approximately three and half thousand satisfied music lovers. This free concert organised to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the AFCM was also a fitting opportunity for BRO to celebrate its 15th Anniversary with it’s first ever outdoor public performance.</p>

<p>The tastes of all music lovers was satiated. The concert opened with the ceremonial and pompous Brass composition by Aaron Copland titled Fanfare for the Common Man, followed by the equally ceremonial Imperial March by William Walton. Genuine fun and musical camaraderie emanated from the performance by Camerata of St Johns with their virtuosic classical performance. In addition they ably accompanied Amy Dickson in her flawless saxophone performance with her distinctive tone clearly displaying the reason she is sought after around the world.</p>

<p>1RAR Big Band played to the high standard Townsville audiences are familiar. They had the audience tapping their feet to their musical and vocal compositions. Cheryl Barker’s powerful soprano rang across the park and most likely was heard on Castle Hill as she sang two arias accompanied by BRO and conducted by UK conductor Nicholas Daniel.</p>

<p>The finale of the afternoon which included musicians from all three ensembles was the 1812 Overture. It was delightful to see the audience enthusiastically participate in this finale. This pleasant afternoon can only be rated as a huge success and may prove to be the first of many performances in years to come. </p>
