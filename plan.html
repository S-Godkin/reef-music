<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group Number: 11</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong>Kyle Bradford, Rob Baetge, Scott Godkin, Phuong Tran</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goals  of this website are to completely revamp it to create a more modern website  which will appeal to a younger audience. This new website should attract many  more users to it simply by making it livelier which in turn will attract more  people who are interested in joining the orchestra. We will aim to have the  website as simple as possible, yet still providing as much information as  possible to the website visitors creating fast and effective means of transmitting our message across to the younger audience. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success  evaluation will be measured by obtaining the numbers of audience members across  a 6 month period. To measure the success of the website the data will be taken  from the amount of people who attend the performances. The data will then be  plotted using excel and a line graph will be created, and from there trends can  be observed as to the success of the new website. To measure the success of the  website in attracting a younger audience we can utilize the data from the &ldquo;sign  up&rdquo; option on the website. By viewing the data we can see the user&rsquo;s details.  These details can be input into a graph and the average age of the user can be  observed. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target  audience for the new website will be young adults. We aim to target young  adults to the orchestra as they are full of talent and maturity and will be a  great addition to the orchestra. <br>
  We will  intentionally design the site to be as simple as possible, less words and more  visualization (images, animations and interactivity). We will use the barrier  reef colours (blue and  green) effectively in the background which will liven up the website and in  turn will make the website bright and really appeal to the younger audience. </p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The content we aim to implement in this website is aimed at making this website as interactive as possible to appeal to a younger audience. Therefore we will be making a photo carousel that people can view photos in a slideshow to see what is happening at Barrier Reef Orchestra without having to read a block of text. There will Google Maps integration for people to easily be able to find us and know exactly where to go, creating a hassle free first time experience. </p>
